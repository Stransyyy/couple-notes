In this project I will be making something that will make me think about my girlfriend and share my thoughts with her. I know some apps might already exist but I want to try by my own.


I will develop the backend, as well as the front-end using VUE???

VUE with questions marks becuase I need to learn it, this is why I think this is a good project, it envolves something personal but at the same time I learn new technologies.

An application like this would look way better on an phone device, so I am as well gonna try to make it for IOS firts, since that is the OS we both have.

##What will it include?

- HTTPS connection
- Endpoints
- Widgets for when it is a phone app
- Sotrage. Alternating on MySQL and Dynamo. Maybe S3 for photos maybe
- Use Spotify API to share each other currently playing music
- Be able to make reminders for when needed. Special dates.
